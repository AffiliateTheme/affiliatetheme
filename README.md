# affiliatetheme.io

The affiliatetheme is a WordPress theme, made by [endcore](https://endcore.com/), perfect for creating new affiliate websites, landing pages or satellite pages. It's an all-in-one solution that doesn't require any other affiliate plugins or any programming skills and helps to earn a income through affiliate marketing.

## Let's start...

### (required) Advanced Custom Fields Pro

The affiliatetheme (in any version) needs the premium plugin "ACF Pro" to work. When our theme was not yet public, the plugin was included with the purchase. However, this is no longer possible with the free / public version. The reason for this is simply the licensing terms of the plugin. We spoke to Advanced Custom Fields and were able to negotiate a 30% coupon for you. Just enter `AFFILIATETHEME-G6LP23` at checkout or directly through the link below. Generally applies to the first year.

### Quick start

Just download the latest release of our theme and upload it into your WordPress. You'll find a tutorial how to install WordPress Themes on our YouTube Channel (link below).

### For existing customer

If you have used our theme before, please see our migration guide from 1.X to 2.0.
